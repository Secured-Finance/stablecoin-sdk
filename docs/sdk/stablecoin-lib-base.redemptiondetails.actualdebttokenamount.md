## RedemptionDetails.actualDebtTokenAmount property

Amount of DebtToken that was actually redeemed by the transaction.

actualDebtTokenAmount: Decimal;
```

## Remarks

This can end up being lower than `attemptedDebtTokenAmount` due to interference from another transaction that modifies the list of Troves.
